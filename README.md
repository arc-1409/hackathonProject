# FootballWatcher

A CLI application for tracking football matches and updates right in your terminal. Inspired by the team's lifelong love of European football, this project aims to provide easy and aesthetic access of live football information using code. 

Our team recognizes a lack of concentrated collection of resources and analyses on football, contrary to other popular sports such as basketball. And as football players and enjoyers ourselves who also love analyzing and debating among ourselves on various aspects of football (teams, players, management, transfers) about as much as we love coding haha, we decide to build a CLI application to fill this gap. This project started on September 20th, but we will continue to build more and more features on it. 

Try guessing which teams we support!

## ‚ú® Existing Features

- Track your football teams' live rankings in Premier League, La Liga, and German Bundesliga

...and more to come in the future!

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **node.js**: javascript environment where this command line project is written on
- **commander.js**: a node.js library, provides definable commands and options that take user input for command line interfaces
- **puppeteer.js**: also a node.js library, performs web-scraping that can do a wide range of tasks on Chrome browsers including looking up information
- **FIGlet**: a program that makes ASCII art. we use this to stylize our application title everytime a user utilizes its functionalities
- **chalk**: a terminal program whose API can add colors to words, including stylized FIGlet art
- **inquirer.js**: another node.js library that also takes prompts, much like commander. we're working on this one!
